A bootloader is a small program that runs when a computer or device is powered on or restarted. Its primary function is to load and start the operating system or firmware of the device. The bootloader is typically stored in a specific area of the device's memory, such as the boot sector of a hard drive or the firmware of a microcontroller.

The bootloader plays a crucial role in the boot process by performing several important tasks:

1. Power-on self-test (POST): The bootloader performs a series of tests to check the hardware components and ensure they are functioning correctly. It verifies the integrity of the system, checks memory, and detects connected devices.

2. Device initialization: The bootloader initializes various hardware components, such as the CPU, memory, and input/output devices, to prepare the system for booting.

3. Bootloader menu (optional): Some bootloaders provide a menu that allows the user to select different boot options, such as choosing between multiple operating systems or recovery modes.

4. Loading the operating system: The primary responsibility of the bootloader is to load the operating system into memory and transfer control to it. It locates the operating system's files, reads them from storage, and loads them into the appropriate memory location. Once the operating system is loaded, the bootloader transfers control to it, allowing the operating system to take over and continue the boot process.

In addition to loading the operating system, bootloaders can also perform other tasks, such as firmware updates, system recovery, or providing a mechanism for dual-booting multiple operating systems on a single device.

Bootloaders are typically specific to the hardware architecture and firmware of the device. Different devices and platforms may have their own bootloader implementations, each tailored to their unique requirements.

Overall, the bootloader is a critical component that facilitates the boot process and enables the loading of the operating system or firmware onto a computer or device when it is powered on or restarted.


#### Step 1. Install efibootmgr
```console
sudo apt install efibootmgr
```

#### Step 2. List all bootloaders

```console
sudo efibootmgr
```
> Be very careful with this next operation because if you delete the wrong bootloader you will no longer have access to the operating system!!
{: .prompt-info }


#### Step 3. Remove bootloader (in this example the bootloader id i want to remove is 0001)

```console
sudo efibootmgr --delete-bootnum --bootnum 0001 
```
Deleting the bootloader from a computer or device can have serious consequences and render the system unable to boot or operate properly. Here are some potential outcomes if you delete the bootloader:

1. Inability to boot: The bootloader is responsible for loading the operating system. If you delete the bootloader, the system will not have a mechanism to locate, load, and start the operating system. As a result, the device may not be able to boot at all, leaving you with a non-functional system.

2. Loss of access to the operating system: Without the bootloader, you won't be able to access the operating system installed on the device. This means you won't have access to your files, applications, or any functionality provided by the operating system.

3. Data loss: Deleting the bootloader itself may not directly result in data loss. However, if you attempt to reconfigure or reinstall the bootloader incorrectly, it could potentially overwrite or damage the data stored on the device. It is crucial to handle bootloader-related operations with caution to prevent unintended data loss.

4. Difficulty in recovery: Deleting the bootloader may complicate the process of recovering or restoring the system. You would need to reinstall the bootloader correctly or restore it from a backup to regain the ability to boot the operating system.

5. Requirement for manual intervention: In some cases, deleting the bootloader may require manual intervention to restore the system's functionality. This could involve reinstalling the operating system or using specialized tools to repair or reinstall the bootloader.
