Welcome

My name is Guilherme aka "GahmaSec" I'm a MTA and CompTIA A+ certified, Helpdesk technician, and a HomeLab enthusiast. I've always loved games. I started with the Playstation 1 and it was an addiction at first sight. I still remember the long hours playing Time Crisis: Project Titan with the old Light Gun Blaze Scorpion.
I like all kinds of games, MMORPG, Beat 'em up, FPS, hack 'n slash, you name it!

To conclude, I can only say that my hobby for a few years now has been my homelab where I dedicate many hours (and truth be told, money too...) to add and improve all the services I need. It's been a great way to learn new tools and explore docker deeper.

The primary objective of this website is to serve as a backup of some learnings that I want to keep in detail, step by step, for when I need them.
This website (not wanting to be egocentric) was designed for me and the way I would like to see information represented that I consider relevant and that has helped me in several practical cases. All my publications are based on my own experience. If you are thinking of "copy pasta" make sure that what you are reading is compatible with your case. And if you have any questions, you can always ask me (I'll be happy to help you).

With this, I hope I can help someone along the way, and if possible create a "community" where we can share ideas and knowledge.

As I believe that we are currently moving from an era of disinformation to an era where anyone can create an account and write whatever they want, I think it is important to have clarity to be able to filter real data from false ones and know how to choose those that are trustworthy. For this same reason, I will use this space to store information (which I spent several hours until I found a solution) and to write a little about the subjects that interest me.

To whoever is reading this post, welcome!
